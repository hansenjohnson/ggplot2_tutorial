# ggplot2_tutorial
Introduction to plotting in ggplot2 (with an ocean focus)

## Summary

I first put this together as an informal tutorial for interested grad students. I decided to convert into **bookdown** and host it publicly in case others find it useful as well. Please get in touch if you notice any issues, or if you have any comments or suggestions.

The book is available [here](https://hansenjohnson.github.io/ggplot2_tutorial/index.html)
