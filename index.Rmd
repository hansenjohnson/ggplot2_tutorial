# Preface

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown','ggplot2','dplyr','oce'), 'packages.bib')
```

Almost none of the ideas here are my own. Most of it is paraphrased from
the wonderful **ggplot2** book [@ggplot22016].

The content of the example plots caters to ocean science applications, but hopefully the concepts are universal.

This tutorial was written using **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
